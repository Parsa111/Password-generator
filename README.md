# This code is a password generator that allows users to create a random password based on their preferences for length, and inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Upon interacting with the webpage's form controls, users can specify their desired password criteria. The password is then generated by randomly selecting characters from the specified character sets, ensuring the generated password meets the user-selected criteria. The result is displayed on the UI, offering a quick and customized way to create secure passwords. The logic includes checks to ensure at least one character type is selected, and utilizes ASCII code ranges to assemble the pool of possible characters for the password.
